# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
In this module we continued to undersatnd the value and power of machine learning by exporing unsupervised machine learning.
This is useful when want to understnad patterns without knowing specifically they will tell us.

A large part of the effort in this module is comprised of cleaning the raw data set that so that the models can leverage it.  The clean up and include the deletion of columns, null values in rows or the converstion of text items into binary numericals.

In this excercise after clenaing data nd running a number of algorythems on it, we created an elbow graph, a 3D Scatter Plot and a Scatter Plot.  All of these used in differnt but related fashions to undersatnd the underlying dataset and the models predictions.
